                            Winning a laptop in the coding competition has been a 
                            significant boost to my learning journey. 
                            It has proven invaluable for coding tasks, 
                            making the learning process more accessible and efficient. 
                            Combined with my coding classes, it has truly enhanced my experience, 
                            providing practicality and convenience in my pursuit of knowledge.

                            The program has exceeded my expectations, the staff at 
                            GirlCode are extremely friendly and always ready to assist 
                            which is a good thing. My hopes for the future are to grow 
                            my skills in the IT industry and see myself growing in whichever company Iâ€™m placed in.

                            My journey has been an amazing experience. 
                            I didn&apos;t even know how much I would grow to love and understand cloud computing.
                             A special shout out to Rumbi and Satish for their patience which led me to become a Certified Cloud Practitioner.

                            Starting the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials with GirlCode has 
                            been a very pleasant and nice experience. 
                            I have also come to build good and meaningful sisterhood 
                            with the ladies I am on the program with. 
                            I am happy and grateful
